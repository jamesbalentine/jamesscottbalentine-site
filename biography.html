                    Composer by character and performer by temperament, James Scott Balentine (Jim to those who know him) is about as complex as his music; that is, moderately mysterious, yet engaging. Jim&#8217;s
                    music is fun and interesting to play, engaging to the listener, and crafted in a personal language influenced by ethnic dance, jazz, folk idioms, and atonal and serial techniques when they seem
                    appropriate.

      <center>Personal</center><br>
      
                  Born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1947, the son of a career Air Force officer, Jim was raised in Paris, France;
                  Montgomery, Alabama; Tachikawa, Japan, and has since lived (from as little as six weeks to ten years) in such diverse locations as Winnipeg (Canada), Edinburgh (Scotland), and Zurich (Switzerland); Midwest City
                  (Oklahoma), San Francisco, Houston, Austin, and Huntsville (Texas), and currently resides in the hill country near San Antonio. He is a certificated private pilot, a pretty good cook, and a passable tennis player (pun
                  intended). Jim and his wife Cindy have three grown children, James, David and Ben, a granddaughter, Terra, and
                  have inherited three beautiful and amazing daughters-in-law, Angie, Elizabeth, and Ashley, from the families McBride, Pena, and McGee, for whom we are exceedingly grateful. <center>We Balentines have been lucky indeed!</center></span>
